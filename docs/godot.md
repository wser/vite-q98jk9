Godot is a general-purpose 2D and 3D game engine designed to support all sorts of projects. You can use it to create games or applications you can then release on desktop or mobile, as well as on the web.

You can also create console games with it, although you either need strong programming skills or a developer to port the game for you.

Godot was initially developed in-house by an Argentinan game studio. Its development started in 2001, and the engine was rewritten and improved tremendously since its open-source release in 2014.

Godot comes with a fully-fledged game editor with integrated tools to answer the most common needs. It includes a code editor, an animation editor, a tilemap editor, a shader editor, a debugger, a profiler, and more.

The team strives to offer a feature-rich game editor with a consistent user experience. While there is always room for improvement, the user interface keeps getting refined.

Of course, if you prefer, you can work with external programs.

You can code your games using GDScript, a Godot-specific and tightly integrated language with a lightweight syntax, or C#, which is popular in the games industry. These are the two main scripting languages we support.

Godot also supports a node-based visual programming language named VisualScript.

With the GDNative technology, you can also write gameplay or high-performance algorithms in C or C++ without recompiling the engine. You can use this technology to integrate third-party libraries and other Software Development Kits (SDK) in the engine.

Of course, you can also directly add modules and features to the engine, as it's completely free and open-source.

Godot is a feature-packed game engine. With its thousands of features, there is a lot to learn. To make the most of it, you need good programming foundations. While we try to make the engine accessible, you will benefit a lot from knowing how to think like a programmer first.
