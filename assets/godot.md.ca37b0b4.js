You can use it to create games or applications you can then release on desktop or mobile, as well as on the web.</p><p>You can also create console games with it, although you either need strong programming skills or a developer to port the game for you.</p><p>Godot was initially developed in-house by an Argentinan game studio. Its development started in 2001, and the engine was rewritten and improved tremendously since its open-source release in 2014.</p><p>Godot comes with a fully-fledged game editor with integrated tools to answer the most common needs. It includes a code editor, an animation editor, a tilemap editor, a shader editor, a debugger, a profiler, and more.</p><p>The team strives to offer a feature-rich game editor with a consistent user experience. While there is always room for improvement, the user interface keeps getting refined.</p><p>Of course, if you prefer, you can work with external programs.</p><p>You can code your games using GDScript, a Godot-specific and tightly integrated language with a lightweight syntax, or C#, which is popular in the games industry. These are the two main scripting languages we support.</p><p>Godot also supports a node-based visual programming language named VisualScript.</p><p>With the GDNative technology, you can also write gameplay or high-performance algorithms in C or C++ without recompiling the engine. You can use this technology to integrate third-party libraries and other Software Development Kits (SDK) in the engine.</p><p>Of course, you can also directly add modules and features to the engine, as it&#39;s completely free and open-source.</p><p>Godot is a feature-packed game engine. With its thousands of features, there is a lot to learn. To make the most of it, you need good programming foundations. While we try to make the engine accessible, you will benefit a lot from knowing how to think like a programmer first.</p>",11),n=[r];function s(p,d,l,c,g,h){return o(),t("div",null,n)}const f=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
